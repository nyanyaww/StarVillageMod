SMAPI lets you run Stardew Valley with mods. Don't forget to download mods separately.


Player's guide
--------------------------------
See https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide for help installing SMAPI, adding mods, etc.


Manual install
--------------------------------
THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR MOST PLAYERS. See instructions above instead.
If you really want to install SMAPI manually, here's how.

1. Unzip "internal/windows-install.dat" (on Windows) or "internal/unix-install.dat" (on Linux/Mac).
   You can change '.dat' to '.zip', it's just a normal zip file renamed to prevent confusion.
2. Copy the files from the folder you just unzipped into your game folder. The
   `StardewModdingAPI.exe` file should be right next to the game's executable.
3.
  - Windows only: if you use Steam, see the install guide above to enable achievements and
    overlay. Otherwise, just run StardewModdingAPI.exe in your game folder to play with mods.

  - Linux/Mac only: rename the "StardewValley" file (no extension) to "StardewValley-original", and
    "StardewModdingAPI" (no extension) to "StardewValley". Now just launch the game as usual to
    play with mods.

When installing on Linux or Mac:
- Make sure Mono is installed (normally the installer checks for you). While it's not required,
  many mods won't work correctly without it. (Specifically, mods which load PNG images may crash or
  freeze the game.)
- To configure the color scheme, edit the `smapi-internal/config.json` file and see instructions
  there for the 'ColorScheme' setting.
